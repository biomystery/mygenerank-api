## Introduction

This repository contains the Django-REST API and wrapper for the computation layer of MyGeneRank, a study run by the Scripps Translational Science Institute.


## About the Study

The goal of this study is to determine how your genetic risk influences health decisions and other things that can be controlled in life. Our first genetic risk score is calculated for coronary artery disease (CAD).
